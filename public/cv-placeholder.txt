# Placeholder for CV PDF

This file should be replaced with the actual CV PDF file.

The CV download button in the Hero component references `/cv.pdf` which should be placed in the public folder.

To use:
1. Place your CV PDF file in this public folder
2. Rename it to `cv.pdf`
3. The download button will automatically work
